# Lily Chalmers' Stats 220 Respository
This is a place for my coursework for Stats220 at UoA

I'm a 2nd year Data Science Student

I spend far too much of my time on letterboxd, [linked here](https://letterboxd.com/lgchalmers/), and here are my top 4 movies OAT.

1. The Worst Person in the World dir. Joachim Trier
2. The Grand Budapest Hotel dir. Wes Anderson
3. Portrait of a Lady on Fire dir. Celine Sciamma
4. La La Land dir. Damien Chazelle

in today's lecture we had to list our favourite beverages so...
### Top 3 undisputed beverages
* Peach Green Tea from Gong Cha
* Iced chocolate (i'm probably *lactose intolerant* tho)
* Mango Dragonfruit Refresher from Starbucks (new but **Purple**)
